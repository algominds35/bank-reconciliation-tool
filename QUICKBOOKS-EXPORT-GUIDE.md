## 📝 **Technical Details:**

### **IIF Format (QuickBooks Desktop):**
```
!TRNS	TRNSID	TRNSTYPE	DATE	ACCNT	NAME	CLASS	AMOUNT	DOCNUM	MEMO
!SPL	SPLID	TRNSTYPE	DATE	ACCNT	NAME	CLASS	AMOUNT	DOCNUM	MEMO
!ENDTRNS
TRNS	1	CHECK	10/15/2024	Checking			-45.99		Walmart
SPL	1	CHECK	10/15/2024	Office Supplies			45.99		Walmart
ENDTRNS
```

- Tab-delimited format
- TRNS = main transaction line
- SPL = split/category line
- ENDTRNS = transaction end marker

### **QBO CSV Format (QuickBooks Online):**
```csv
Date,Description,Amount,Category,Account,Payee,Tax
10/15/2024,Walmart,-45.99,Office Supplies,Checking,Walmart,Non
10/16/2024,Gas Station,-35.00,Fuel,Checking,Gas Station,Non
```

- Standard CSV with specific column headers
- Negative amounts for expenses
- Positive amounts for income
- QBO recognizes these columns automatically

3. **Custom Export Templates** (3 days) - Let users customize columns
4. **Scheduled Reports** (1 week) - Email weekly duplicate reports
5. **Zapier Integration** (1 week) - Connect to 1000+ apps

### **Don't Build (Yet):**
