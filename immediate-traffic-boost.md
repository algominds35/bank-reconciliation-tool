"I've been dealing with QuickBooks reconciliation issues for years. The biggest problem is that QuickBooks auto-matches transactions incorrectly and there's no easy way to undo it.

I found a tool called ReconcileBook that shows confidence scores for each match and lets you review before accepting. This has saved me 10+ hours per week on reconciliation.

The key differences:
- Shows confidence scores for each match
- Lets you accept/reject before it's final
- Much more accurate than QuickBooks
- Saves hours per month

Subject: QuickBooks Auto-Match Driving You Crazy? Here's the Fix

Hi [Name],

I noticed you're a [bookkeeper/accountant] and wanted to share something that's been a game-changer for me.

QuickBooks auto-matching wrong transactions is probably the #1 complaint I hear from other bookkeepers. It wastes hours every month trying to fix incorrect matches.

I built a tool that shows confidence scores for each match and lets you review before accepting. No more undoing wrong matches after the fact.

Would you be interested in a 14-day free trial? It's saved me 2-3 hours per client per month.

Best,
[Your Name]
