            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              It's 4:47 PM on a Friday. You just spent 3 hours reconciling your biggest client's business checking account. All 247 transactions matched perfectly. Beginning balance: ✓. Ending balance: ✓. You hit "Finish Now" and start closing your laptop.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Monday morning at 9:03 AM, you open QuickBooks to print the reconciliation report for your client meeting at 10:00 AM.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4 font-semibold text-lg">

            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              The reconciliation report shows a <strong className="text-red-600">$347.62 discrepancy</strong>. The beginning balance is suddenly off. Transactions you reconciled on Friday are now showing as "unreconciled." It's like your entire afternoon vanished.

              Sound familiar? This exact scenario happens to thousands of bookkeepers every single week. And here's the worst part: Most people waste 6-10 hours "fixing" it the wrong way.

          <h2 className="text-4xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-8">Why QuickBooks Reconciliation Errors Happen (And Why They're So Frustrating)</h2>
          
          <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
            Before we fix the problem, let's understand what causes reconciliation discrepancies in the first place. Knowing the "why" helps you prevent future errors and diagnose issues faster.
          </p>

          {/* Cause 1 */}
          <div className="bg-white border border-slate-200 rounded-xl p-6 mb-6 shadow-sm hover:shadow-md transition-shadow">
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4">1. Deleted or Modified Transactions After Reconciliation</h3>
            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              <strong>The scenario:</strong> You reconcile on January 5th. On January 12th, your client asks you to change a transaction date from December to November. You update it without thinking twice.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              <strong>The problem:</strong> That transaction was part of December's reconciliation. By changing its date, you just broke the beginning balance for January—and QuickBooks won't warn you.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
              <strong>Why it's so frustrating:</strong> The error might not surface until weeks later. By then, you've done 3 more reconciliations, and now you're hunting through hundreds of transactions trying to figure out what changed.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Cause 2 */}
          <div className="bg-white border border-slate-200 rounded-xl p-6 mb-6 shadow-sm hover:shadow-md transition-shadow">
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4">2. Duplicate Transaction Imports from Bank Feeds</h3>
            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              This is the <strong>#1 cause</strong> of reconciliation headaches. Duplicates sneak in when:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-slate-700 space-y-2">
              <li>A client manually enters a transaction, then accepts the same one from the bank feed</li>
              <li>The bank feed disconnects and re-syncs, importing transactions twice</li>
              <li>You upload a CSV file, then the bank feed imports the same data</li>
              <li>Credit card transactions appear on overlapping statements (more on this below)</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
              <strong>The trap:</strong> You might reconcile successfully in March, but the duplicate doesn't cause a visible discrepancy until April when it affects your beginning balance. By then, you're searching for a needle in a haystack of 300+ transactions.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Cause 3 */}
          <div className="bg-white border border-slate-200 rounded-xl p-6 mb-6 shadow-sm hover:shadow-md transition-shadow">
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4">3. Missing Transactions from Broken Bank Feeds</h3>
            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Bank feeds are amazing—until they're not. Here's what happens:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-slate-700 space-y-2">
              <li>Your bank updates its authentication system → QuickBooks feed breaks silently</li>
              <li>Security settings get reset → Transactions stop importing</li>
              <li>The feed works intermittently → You get Monday and Wednesday transactions but miss Tuesday</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
              You don't realize anything is wrong until your reconciliation doesn't balance. Then you're manually cross-referencing bank statements against QuickBooks to find the gaps.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Cause 4 */}
          <div className="bg-white border border-slate-200 rounded-xl p-6 mb-6 shadow-sm hover:shadow-md transition-shadow">
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4">4. Credit Card Statement Overlaps (The Silent Killer)</h3>
            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Credit cards have a unique problem: <strong>transactions can appear on multiple statement periods.</strong>
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              <strong>Example:</strong> Your Amex statement closes on March 28th. But transactions that posted on March 26th-28th might also show up on your April 1st statement due to processing delays.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              If you're importing from multiple sources (bank feed + CSV + manual entry), you'll reconcile these transactions twice—once in March, once in April. This creates artificial duplicates that throw off your balance.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed font-medium">
              <strong>Real case:</strong> A bookkeeper we work with had 23 duplicate credit card transactions spanning 3 months. She spent 7 hours finding them manually. Our tool found them in 12 seconds.
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* Cause 5 */}
          <div className="bg-white border border-slate-200 rounded-xl p-6 mb-6 shadow-sm hover:shadow-md transition-shadow">
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-4">5. Incorrect Opening Balances and Prior Period Adjustments</h3>
            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Your QuickBooks opening balance should match the ending balance from your previous reconciliation. But what happens when:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-slate-700 space-y-2">
              <li>Someone makes a prior period adjustment <em>after</em> you've reconciled</li>
              <li>A vendor refund from last month posts in the current month</li>
              <li>An old check from 6 months ago finally clears</li>
              <li>Your previous reconciliation had a hidden error</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
              Now your opening balance is "wrong" even though your current month's transactions are perfect. You're stuck with a discrepancy you can't fix by reconciling the current period.

            <h2 className="text-4xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-6">Why "Undo and Start Over" Is the WORST Solution</h2>
            
            <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              When you Google "QuickBooks reconciliation discrepancy" or call QuickBooks support, you'll hear the same advice: <strong>"Undo your reconciliations and start fresh."</strong>
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-xl font-semibold text-red-700 mb-4">
              This is terrible advice. Here's why:

              <div>
                <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-3">⏰ The Time Trap</h3>
                <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                  Let's say you discover an error in June, but it started in February. You need to undo <strong>5 months of work</strong>. If each reconciliation takes 2-3 hours, you're looking at <strong>10-15 hours of re-work</strong> just to get back to where you already were.
                </p>
                <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mt-3 font-medium">
                  And here's the kicker: Undoing reconciliations <strong>doesn't fix the underlying problem.</strong> Those duplicates are still there. You'll hit the exact same errors again.
                </p>
              </div>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-3">🔍 The Audit Trail Disaster</h3>
                <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                  When you undo reconciliations in QuickBooks, you're not just reverting changes—<strong>you're erasing financial history.</strong> This creates serious problems:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-3 text-slate-700 space-y-2">
                  <li><strong>Audit compliance issues:</strong> Auditors need unbroken reconciliation history. Gaps raise red flags.</li>
                  <li><strong>Lost documentation:</strong> Reports you sent to clients won't match QuickBooks anymore.</li>
                  <li><strong>Regulatory violations:</strong> Some industries require unbroken audit trails by law.</li>
                  <li><strong>Internal control failures:</strong> You can't track who changed what and when.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <div>
                <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-3">😰 The Error Multiplication Effect</h3>
                <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                  Re-reconciling from scratch often <strong>introduces NEW errors.</strong> Why? Because you're tired, frustrated, and rushing. You might mark the wrong transactions as cleared, miss entries, or enter incorrect ending balances.
                </p>
                <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mt-3 font-medium">
                  Now you have the original error PLUS new errors to fix. You're in deeper than when you started.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div>
                <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 mb-3">💔 The Client Trust Problem</h3>
                <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed italic">
                  "Hey client, remember those financial statements I sent last month? And the tax return we filed? Well, I had to undo all the reconciliations, so those numbers might not be accurate. We're starting over."
                </p>
                <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mt-3">
                  That's a conversation no bookkeeper wants to have. It destroys client confidence—even though the error wasn't your fault.

              <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                Go to <strong>Reports → Custom Reports → Transaction Detail</strong> and export your bank transactions for the affected account. Save this as your "baseline" file—it shows what's currently in QuickBooks.

                Upload both your QuickBooks export and your latest bank statement (CSV, OFX, or QBO format) to a reconciliation tool like ReconcileBook. The system will automatically compare the two files.

                Set your "last import date" to the date of your last successful reconciliation. This filters out everything that was already reconciled correctly, so you only review <strong>new or changed transactions.</strong>

                <strong>The Problem:</strong> Sarah, a bookkeeper in Austin, TX, discovered her client's reconciliation was off by $0.01. Yes, <strong>one penny.</strong>

              <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                <strong>The Old Way:</strong> She would have spent 3-4 hours manually comparing 412 transactions between QuickBooks and the bank statement, line by line, looking for that single penny difference.

              <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                <strong>The Smart Way:</strong> She uploaded both files to ReconcileBook's file comparison tool. In <strong>12 seconds</strong>, the system flagged a duplicate transaction: A $247.83 vendor payment that was entered manually, then accepted again from the bank feed.

              <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
                The duplicate had a rounding difference of $0.01 due to how the bank feed formatted the amount. Sarah deleted the duplicate, re-reconciled, and was done in <strong>5 minutes total.</strong>
